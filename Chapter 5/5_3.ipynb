    "k-fold is splitting a data set in k parts. So if k=2, it will split the data set in two parts of half the size of the overall set, and if k=n, it will split the data in k parts of size 1.  \n",
    "Once we have these k parts, we combine all of them but one together to create the training set. The one part left out will serve as the validation set.\n",
